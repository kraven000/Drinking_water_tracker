# 💧 Water Intake Tracker

**Water Intake Tracker** is a Python-based application that helps you monitor and track your daily water consumption. This app encourages you to stay hydrated by setting personalized daily water intake goals, sending notifications at regular intervals, and displaying your progress through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

- **Hydration Notifications:** Receive timely reminders to drink water with fun facts to keep you motivated.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual representation of your water intake progress, displaying the percentage of your target achieved.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive GUI built with Tkinter for easy tracking and updates on your hydration status.
- **Data Persistence:** Keeps track of your daily water intake and progress even after you close the app.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- Required Python libraries:
  - Tkinter (included with Python)
  - plyer (`pip install plyer`)
  - playsound (`pip install playsound`)
  
## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-intake-tracker.git
   cd water-intake-tracker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Initial Setup:** Upon first launch, the app will prompt you to enter your age, gender, daily water target (in ml), and the time interval for notifications.
   
2. **Track Your Water Intake:**
   - Enter the amount of water you drink (e.g., 250 ml, 500 ml) using the dropdown menu and click the "DRANKED!!" button to update your intake.
   - The GUI will display your current progress, including the total amount of water consumed and the percentage of your daily target achieved.

3. **Stay Notified:**
   - The app will send periodic notifications to remind you to drink water based on your specified interval.
   - Motivational messages will be displayed to keep you engaged and informed about the benefits of hydration.

4. **Visual Progress:** 
   - A progress bar will visually depict your water intake relative to your daily target, making it easy to see how much you’ve accomplished.

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.py`: Main script containing the logic for tracking water intake, displaying notifications, and managing the GUI.
- `info.dat`: File used to store user data and progress.
- `facts.dat`: Contains fun facts for notifications.
- `water_icon.ico`: Icon used for desktop notifications.
- `saahil.mp3`: Audio file played during notifications.

## 📝 Note

- Ensure that `info.dat` and `facts.dat` are properly set up in the same directory as `main.py`.
- Customize the notification sound by replacing `saahil.mp3` with any sound file of your choice.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Integration with health APIs for personalized water goals.
- More engaging notifications with different sounds and visuals.
- Mobile compatibility and cross-platform support.
